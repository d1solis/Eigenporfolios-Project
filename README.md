# Eigenporfolios Project

## Overview
This project explores the application of linear algebra, specifically Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), in finance and algorithmic trading. The goal is to create a portfolio of company allocations by analyzing the daily prices of over 1,000 companies. We use SVD to generate the right singular vectors, which are then normalized to form "eigen-portfolios." The process involves training on past data to test the performance of these portfolios.

## Features
- **Data Import and Preprocessing:** Efficiently load and clean large datasets.
- **SVD-Based Portfolio Construction:** Apply SVD to derive eigenportfolios from return data.
- **Portfolio Normalization:** Normalize the SVD-derived portfolios for practical implementation.
- **Data Visualization:** Graphs and charts to visualize key trends in gun violence.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** The main programming language used.
- **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation and analysis as well as handling large datasets.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For creating visualizations of data and results.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For running and sharing code.
